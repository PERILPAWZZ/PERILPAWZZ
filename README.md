- doubles r fine but be careful!
- i share this account with 2 of my best buds, my qpp & my cousin!! someone asked if we're a system, we are most definitely not a system (nothing's wrong with systems lmao im just saying)
- c+h always unless my display name says dni. even when i dont have c+h on my name!!
- dont cover me pls its annoying /nm
- im 14, dont be a nasty dog (11 and under dni bc you will be blocked & hidden instantly. 12 yr olds on thin ice, i'll block you if you're annoying enough lolol)
- tbh its kinda stupid having a huge dni on a pixel pony game so just basic criteria ig.. oh and ppl who thirst over biografts you guys are weird
- remaking strawpage soon
- iwc = interact with caution. im either sleepy, afk, or i have a bad connection. expect disconnecting and slow responses (or no response at all)
- iwec = interact with extreme caution. im really pissed and/or exiting an episode of some kind (panic attack, derealization, etc.) . usually if i have this tag AND c+h at the same time it means i dont want to interact by talking
- iwvec = im either actively having a manic episode (in that case, i cannot tell reality from delusion and i will say crazy shit) or my grandma is peeping at my device. just be careful and dont say anything that a queerphobic trump-supporring antifurry evangelist granny wouldn't approve of. if i walk away mid-convo, do not follow me because it could be for a number of reasons. also same with iwec: if i have this tag and c+h in my name with it, it means id rather you not talk to me unless absolutely necessary. you dont have to ask to sit with me or anything
- dniuid = dont interact unless i do first
- dniubf = dont interact unless best friend. a lot of ppl use this meaning ¬®do not interact unless boyfriend¬® but thats not the case with me!! i have a gf but i cant convince her to get pt üíî
- people who dont listen to my display name tag things shall be taken to the landfill by sunrise tomorrow
