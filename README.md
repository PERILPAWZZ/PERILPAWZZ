- hiya, im subspace!! dont panic or anything but i got caught running away and i won't be home for a week or longer (and when i do get home, i'll likely be grounded or worse). i was only allowed to take my school chromebook with me and if im on PT at all, its bc im in a safe spot and im using PT to somehow talk to my long distance friend.
- i will be very inactive on 12/12/24 and beyond. its related to the running away thing. hehe oops sorry i wanted to escape one of the scariest places ive ever been in life XP
- doubles r fine but be careful!
- i share this account with 2 of my best buds, my qpp & my cousin!! it's probably only gonna be me on here lately tho
- c+h always unless my display name says dni. even when i dont have c+h on my name!!
- dont cover me pls its annoying /nm
- im 14, dont be a nasty dog (11 and under dni bc you will be blocked & hidden instantly. 12 yr olds on thin ice, i'll block you if i think i should)
- tbh its kinda stupid having a huge dni on a pixel pony game so just basic criteria ig.. oh and ppl who thirst over biografts you guys are weird
- remaking strawpage soon
- i ltrly cannot believe i have to say this but my mom's dog doesnt gaf what im doing and sits on my keyboard ALL THE GD TIME /srs so if i randomly boop, kiss, or walk into you it's her fault. im writing this minutes after kissing the air 3 times due to the dog and i feel like it needs a warning now
- dniuid = dont interact unless i do first
- dniubf = dont interact unless best friend. a lot of ppl use this meaning ¨do not interact unless boyfriend¨ but thats not the case with me!! i sadly dont have any partners anymore but um thats a different story for a different time
- people who dont listen to my display name tag things shall be taken to the landfill by sunrise tomorrow
