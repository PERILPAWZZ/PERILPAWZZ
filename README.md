- hiya, im subspace!! dont panic or anything but i got caught running away and i won't be home for a week or longer (and when i do get home, i'll likely be grounded or worse). i was only allowed to take my school chromebook with me and if im on PT at all, its bc im in a safe spot and im using PT to somehow talk to my long distance friend
- doubles r fine but be careful!
- i share this account with 2 of my best buds, my qpp & my cousin!! it's probably only gonna be me on here lately tho
- c+h always unless my display name says dni. even when i dont have c+h on my name!!
- dont cover me pls its annoying /nm
- im 14, dont be a nasty dog (11 and under dni bc you will be blocked & hidden instantly. 12 yr olds on thin ice, i'll block you if i think i should)
- tbh its kinda stupid having a huge dni on a pixel pony game so just basic criteria ig.. oh and ppl who thirst over biografts you guys are weird
- remaking strawpage soon
